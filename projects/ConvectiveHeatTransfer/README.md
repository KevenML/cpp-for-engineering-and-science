# Convective Heat Transfer Calculator

## Overview

This project implements a **Convective Heat Transfer Calculator** using **Newton’s Law of Cooling** in C++.  
It is designed as an engineering analysis tool similar to real thermal engineering calculations.

The program computes heat transfer between a surface and surrounding fluid using user-provided parameters.

## Engineering Model

Newton’s Law of Cooling:

\[
Q = hA(T_s - T_\infty)
\]

Where:

| Symbol | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Q | Heat transfer rate |
| h | Heat transfer coefficient |
| A | Surface area |
| Ts | Surface temperature |
| T∞ | Ambient temperature |
